# Global context code transform

This is only a prototype repo, so the DX is not that advanced (sorry).

In order to start the demo:

* Run `yarn` at the repo root to install all deps
* Run `yarn build` for
  * babel-preset
  * global-context
  * global-context-selector
* Run `yarn serve` in the `webpack-example` folder
